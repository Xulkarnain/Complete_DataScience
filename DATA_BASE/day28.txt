📦 What is a Database & Why Do We Need It?
A database is an organized collection of data that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and updating of information.

You can store data in CSV or JSON files, but:

These are file-based, not scalable

Difficult to update, search, or manage relationships

Poor for concurrent access or data security

That’s where databases shine — they allow structured and efficient data operations, especially in large-scale or multi-user environments.

🗃️ What is a Relational Database (RDBMS)?
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) stores data in tables (rows and columns) — similar to an Excel sheet.

Each table represents an entity (e.g., users, products), and relationships between tables are defined using keys (primary key, foreign key).

Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle

There are also non-relational (NoSQL) databases — we’ll explore them later.

🧠 Database Languages
1️⃣ DDL – Data Definition Language
Used to define the schema/structure of the database.

👉 Tasks:

Create tables, define columns and data types

Add constraints (like primary keys)

Manage schema-level objects

✅ Common DDL Commands:

CREATE – Create a new table or database

ALTER – Modify existing schema

DROP – Delete schema or table

TRUNCATE – Remove all data, keep structure

RENAME – Rename table or column

2️⃣ DML – Data Manipulation Language
Used to insert, modify, or retrieve data from the database.

👉 Tasks:

Insert new records

Update or delete existing ones

Query for specific data

✅ Common DML Commands:

SELECT – Retrieve data

INSERT – Add new data

UPDATE – Modify data

DELETE – Remove data

🗣️ What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with RDBMS.
It is not Turing complete, meaning it can’t perform all types of computations — it's not designed to replace general-purpose programming languages.

But it's perfect for querying and managing structured data efficiently.
